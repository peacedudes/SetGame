#  Animated Set

Stanford CS193 Spring 2021 Assignment IV. The game of Set with animations.

###   This is a Demo for a class assignment.

This code is NOT copyrighted by me in any way.  However, some of the code
contained within this project was presented in class, or has been derived 
from code presented in the Stanford class without much change.  It may be
of questionable copyright.

The artwork and concept for the SET card game itself are likely owned by
the original author and protected by copyright laws, and have been used here without 
without legal rights or seeking any kind of permission whatsoever.

This game is not, and can never be for sale.  It is offered as an example
of code produced by the author.  

Compared to production quality code it is incomplete.  Most importantly, 
it completely lacks unit tests (and I do feel guilty about this). The game
plays a reasonable solataire game of SET and fulfills a class assignment,
with extra credit.

Most of code in these files was produced by me, with help of Stack Overflow,
and other online resources. If anyone can learn from it, or has use for
any of the parts I created, it's yours for the taking.  Enjoy.
