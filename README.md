#  Animated Set

Stanford CS193 Spring 2021 Assignment IV. The game of Set with animations.

###   This is a Demo for a class assignment.

This code is NOT copyrighted by me in any way.  However, some of the code
contained within this project was presented in class, or has been derived 
from code presented in the Stanford class without much change.  It may be
of questionable copyright.

The artwork and concept for the SET card game itself are likely owned by
the original author and protected by copyright laws, and have been used  
without legal rights or seeking any kind of permission.

This game is not, and can never be for sale.  It is offered as an example
of code produced by the author.  Compared to production quality code it is 
incomplete... especially because it lacks unit tests. The game plays a
reasonable solitaire game of SET fulfilling a class assignment, with extra credit.

Most of code in these files was produced by me, with help of Stack Overflow,
and other online resources. If anyone can learn from it or make use of any of
the parts I wrote, it's yours for the taking.  Enjoy.
